PPC Analytics Project – Adrian Luis-Martinez

  This folder contains the core files from my end-to-end analytics project analyzing digital ad campaign performance.

  Overview:
	The goal was to evaluate which platforms, content types, and audience segments delivered the strongest 	ROI across 1,000+ marketing campaigns. I built the entire pipeline independently, from data cleaning and transformation to SQL analysis and Tableau dashboard delivery.

What's Inside:

  01. PPC_Campaign_Clean_Final.csv  
	→ Final cleaned dataset used for all analysis and dashboard builds.

  02. PPC_Campaign_Data_Cleaning.ipynb  
	→ Initial data cleaning notebook: formatting, null handling, and transformation.

  03. PPC_Campaign_Data_Cleaning_2.ipynb  
	→ Final fix notebook: corrected an issue where IDs weren’t truly unique, resulting in dropped rows. This ensured all 1,000 campaigns were retained after export.

  04. PPC_Campaign_Queries_and_Insights.sql  
	→ Query file used to extract all insights for dashboards and reflection section.

  05. PPC_Campaign_Performance_Visualization.twbx  
	→ Tableau workbook file with all dashboards used in the final report (also published on Tableau Public and embedded in the live site).

Note:
	All files were developed independently and are included for transparency and deeper review. The 	dashboards can also be viewed interactively on my project website:
